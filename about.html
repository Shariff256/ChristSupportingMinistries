        <h2>About Christ Supporting Ministry</h2>
        <p>
            Christ Supporting Ministry is a Christian-founded organization based in Kabarole and Kyenjojo Districts, carrying out activities such as healthcare support and preaching the Gospel of God.
        </p>

        <p>
            The organization began as a special calling from God revealed to Mrs. Kyakyo Beatrice. After sharing with the church, it was confirmed that supporting orphans, vulnerable children, women, and youth was part of God’s mission.
